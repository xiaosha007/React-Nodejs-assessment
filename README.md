# An assessment for job interview

The server folder contains all the backend part that is used to process the text file uploaded

The frontend folder contains all the react code for front end

Before running both server and frontend, please run npm i to install all the necessary modules.

## Brief description
This is a simple application that is created using pure html for frontend and node js for hosting the backend server. The purpose is to demonstrate the ability to separate both frontend and backend and to connect them with each other.
